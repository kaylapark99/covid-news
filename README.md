# covid19-news

NOTE: the articles and videos selected and display in thie project are not meant to represent my personal views. I created this news source to shed light on the varying opinions on one serious topic.

I fetched daily COVID Updates through https://api.covid19api.com/summary. The user can view both global and country based updates. The user selects the country using a dropdown menu, and an embedded graph will display a linear graph representing the death count for that specific country.

As of now, there are three COVID related topics I decided to focus on. I plan on adding more in the future. These topics include vaccines, reportings, and regulations. I utilized this API https://currentsapi.services/en to fetch the latest articles for each of these topics. In addition, I made Twitter Lists and embedded the tweets in order to display updated tweets from selected users. 

Finally, I added a total death count that is stored in local storage. This tracks how many people on average have died from COVID-19 throughout the duration of your time viewing my site. 

I am currently in the process of making the site responsive across all devices using Bootstrap.
